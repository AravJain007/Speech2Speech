### Speech2Speech Agent Implementation

**Current Status:**
I have made significant progress in implementing a Speech2Speech agent with the goal of creating a real-time demo using a Streamlit app. However, the integration with ngrok encountered issues, preventing full deployment. WebRTC could be a viable alternative for streaming audio from a browser microphone to a server, but due to time constraints from mid-term examinations, I was unable to implement it. I plan to continue developing this project to achieve near real-time performance.

**Performance Enhancement Suggestions:**
The current solution has a latency of 21 seconds. This can be reduced by streaming the audio output using one of the following methods:
- **XTTS V2:** Tokenizes input text and feeds it to a speech synthesis model, producing audio chunks.
- **Orca Streaming Text-to-Speech:** Synthesizes audio while the Large Language Model (LLM) is still generating a response.

Additionally, utilizing a more recent GPU architecture that supports FP4 or faster INT4 kernels could significantly reduce output times, enhancing the real-time capabilities of the system.

**LLM Routing:**
Incorporating LLM routing can optimize performance by assessing the complexity of the query and directing it to an appropriately sized LLM. This can be implemented using [RouteLLM](https://github.com/lm-sys/RouteLLM), which would improve both cost efficiency and response time.
